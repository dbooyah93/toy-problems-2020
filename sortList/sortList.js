PROMPT
---
Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.
Try to sort the linked list in O(n logn) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space).

---
EXAMPLES
---
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]

Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]

Input: head = []
Output: []

---
CONSTRAINTS
---
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5

Definition for singly-linked list:
function ListNode(val, next) {
     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next);
  }

var sortList = function(head) {
